                <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The selected artifact for this enhancement is my “Recipe Finder” application, originally created in a previous course and refined throughout CS-499. This React-based web application allows users to search for recipes using the MealDB API. For the database-focused enhancement, I introduced a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to support a new user review system. This version was developed during Module Five and is hosted on both Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend), with a functional MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
                </p>

                <h3>Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    I selected this artifact for my database enhancement because it offered a practical and user-facing opportunity to implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a real NoSQL database. The implementation showcases essential database skills, including schema design, backend routing, RESTful API development, and secure interaction with a frontend React app. Specifically, I replaced the previous static JSON data model with dynamic data storage using MongoDB, enabling real-time review persistence across sessions and devices.
                </p>

                <h3>How the Artifact was Improved</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Originally, recipe reviews were stored in a local JSON file. In this enhancement:
                    <li>I created a backend with Express and connected it to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.</li>
                    <li>Defined a Review model schema to include recipe ID, user email, user name, rating, comment, and timestamp.</li>
                    <li>Built API endpoints to fetch, post, update, and delete reviews (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
                    <li>Updated the frontend to display reviews per recipe from MongoDB using dynamic fetching.</li>
                    <li>Enabled logged-in users to submit new reviews, as well as edit or delete their own.</li>
                    <li>Replaced previous hardcoded values with real user authentication context using Google OAuth.</li>
                    <li>Included client-side sorting (by rating or date) for improved data accessibility.</li>
                </p>

                <h3>Alignment with Course Outcomes</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    This enhancement aligns directly with the following course outcomes:
                    <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals: I implemented a full-stack database solution with industry tools like Express and MongoDB Atlas.</li>
                    <li>Develop a security mindset: I ensured only authenticated users could post, edit, or delete reviews, and verified review ownership through user email matching.</li>
                    <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions using computer science practices and standards: I designed and tested a REST API for review handling and integrated it into a front-end framework.</li>
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Transitioning from static JSON files to MongoDB required thoughtful backend design and a deeper understanding of RESTful API structures. One challenge was ensuring proper authentication and ownership verification for user-specific review actions. Another was managing asynchronous data fetching and state updates within React.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this process, I gained valuable experience in:
                    <li>Structuring NoSQL databases for scalable, user-generated content.</li>
                    <li>Writing secure and maintainable backend routes.</li>
                    <li>Connecting frontend components to cloud-hosted databases.</li>
                    <li>Deploying and managing full-stack applications using Netlify and Render.</li>
                    <br>
                    This enhancement reflects not only my technical growth but also my ability to deliver production-quality features that offer real value to users.
