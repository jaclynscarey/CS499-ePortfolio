                <p class="mb-2">
                    Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing the ePortfolio has helped me reflect on how far I've come both professionally and personally. I am currently employed as a Software Development Engineer at Adobe, where I have had the opportunity to work on impactful projects involving mobile application performance, automation, and cross-platform systems. However, my academic journey at SNHU has significantly deepened my understanding of core computer science concepts, and I feel more ready than ever to take on greater responsibilities and pursue future promotions within my organization. My Computer Science degree includes a concentration in Information Security, which further complements my focus on building secure, scalable systems.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    This program has helped me shape my professional goals by reinforcing the importance of foundational knowledge, practical application, and lifelong learning. Through my coursework, I honed my abilities in secure coding practices, algorithm design, database implementation, and collaborative development. I've also learned how to assess trade-offs when making design choices and gained confidence in building scalable, maintainable applications.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Outside of technical growth, the program emphasized real-world collaboration, communication, and project documentation. Presenting my work through code reviews and written documentation taught me how to explain complex technical ideas to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This skill has been particularly useful in my role at Adobe, where cross-functional collaboration is essential.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    My experience also includes practicing Agile methodologies and Scrum practices, including earning my PSM I, Professional Scrum Master I, certification. These practices have enabled me to thrive in team-based environments where iteration, feedback, and flexibility are key.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    From a technical perspective, my studies have strengthened my skills in data structures and algorithms through targeted assignments and enhancement projects. I explored time complexity, sorting techniques, and optimized data retrieval in my capstone project. I also gained hands-on experience in software engineering through full-stack development, including user authentication, secure data handling, and API integration. My database coursework and final enhancement showcased my ability to implement scalable and secure data storage using MongoDB.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Security was another recurring theme throughout the program. I practiced building secure systems by implementing OAuth, restricting access, validating user input, and learning about common vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques. This security-focused mindset has become part of my daily engineering practice.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    The artifacts in my portfolio come together to form a cohesive picture of my capabilities. Each enhancement builds upon a single full-stack project, the Recipe Finder App, allowing me to demonstrate progress across three critical areas of computer science: software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. In each phase, I identified gaps, implemented meaningful improvements, and documented my reasoning and outcomes.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Together, these enhancements demonstrate not only my ability to write effective code but also my understanding of user experience, performance optimization, and secure data handling. They illustrate my readiness for higher-level responsibilities and my ability to contribute value in real-world engineering environments.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-2">
                    This portfolio tells the story of a developer who combines hands-on skill with strategic thinking and continuous learning—qualities I will continue to apply as I advance in my career.
