                <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The artifact I selected for Enhancement Two is my Recipe Finder App, originally built during my time at General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. This application allows users to search for recipes from TheMealDB API by ingredient, nationality, or recipe name. In its original version, the app featured basic search capabilities and clean UI components using React but lacked interactivity beyond search and display. There was no user-specific data or structured data manipulation within the app itself.
                </p>

                <h3>Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    This artifact was selected for my ePortfolio because it allowed me to showcase my ability to design and implement algorithmic features in a real-world context. Specifically, for this enhancement, I implemented user review functionality and integrated client-side sorting capabilities. These changes transformed the project from a static search-and-display application into an interactive platform capable of handling user-generated data and applying algorithmic logic to improve the user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    To meet the goals of this enhancement, I added a review system that:
                    <li>Stores and displays user-generated reviews from a temporary JSON dataset.</li>
                    <li>Allows users to sort reviews by date (newest to oldest, oldest to newest) or rating (highest to lowest, lowest to highest).</li>
                    <li>Renders reviews using a reusable React component with props for sorting.</li>
                    <li>Implements sorting using JavaScript array methods with conditional logic based on selected sort type.</li>
                    <br>
                    These enhancements highlight my skills in working with data structures such as arrays of objects and applying algorithmic logic to handle user preferences and ensure efficient rendering. Moreover, designing the component to be reusable demonstrates my understanding of scalable design principles in React.
                </p>

                <h3>Outcome Alignment and Updates</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    This enhancement supports multiple CS-499 course outcomes:
                    <li>Outcome 3: Algorithmic Problem Solving – The review sorting mechanism required me to design a flexible, efficient client-side sorting solution that applies algorithmic principles using JavaScript. This enhancement is a clear demonstration of manipulating data structures to solve a practical problem.</li>
                    <li>Outcome 4: Innovative Computing Techniques – The review feature integrates seamlessly into the application, improving functionality and simulating real-world application behavior. My use of reusable components and sorting logic aligns with scalable software design patterns.</li>
                    <li>Outcome 2: Professional Communication – The review interface and sorting dropdown present information to users in a clear, user-friendly way, improving usability and demonstrating thoughtful UI/UX design.</li>
                    <br>
                    My outcome coverage plan remains largely unchanged. Enhancement Two further advances my progress toward full proficiency in algorithm design and data structure manipulation.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Implementing the user reviews and sorting features pushed me to think critically about how to manipulate and display structured data in an efficient and user-friendly manner. While creating the reusable review component was straightforward, developing the sorting logic required careful consideration of how users interact with the feature. I ensured the sorting logic was both flexible and performant.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the biggest challenges was maintaining clean component communication and state management without a global store like Redux. I addressed this by managing state locally and passing props effectively, which solidified my understanding of React’s data flow. Another technical challenge was implementing default and fallback UI behaviors for edge cases, such as when no reviews exist.
                    <br><br>
                    I also learned how small enhancements can significantly improve the perceived complexity and interactivity of an application. Adding the ability to sort and view user-generated reviews transformed a basic application into one that better simulates a real-world web product.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    This enhancement demonstrates my ability to build client-facing features that involve data manipulation, algorithmic thinking, and front-end engineering best practices. It also sets the foundation for future enhancements that will integrate real database functionality, authentication-aware review controls, and server-side persistence. The improved version of my Recipe Finder App not only meets the learning objectives of CS-499 but also showcases my readiness for professional roles involving algorithm design and user experience development.
