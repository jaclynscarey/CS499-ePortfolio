                    This enhancement was developed on top of the same Recipe Finder App used in Enhancement One. For Enhancement Two, I enhanced the existing review functionality by implementing a dynamic sorting feature for user-submitted reviews. This enhancement, which falls under the <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong> category, builds on the previously established recipe application and demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and optimize data-driven front-end features.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Because this enhancement used static data instead of a live backend, reviews are only available for the "Sushi" recipe, which can be accessed by searching for "Sushi" by name.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    To accomplish this, I used JavaScript’s native array methods to implement sorting functionality. The system dynamically responds to user input by re-rendering reviews based on selected sort criteria. While the initial implementation uses in-memory data, the architecture is designed to scale with future backend integrations. The enhancement required parsing timestamped entries and comparing numerical rating values in real-time, which helped solidify my understanding of client-side data manipulation and sorting algorithms, such as comparison-based sorting. I also ensured accessibility by implementing intuitive dropdown selectors and fallback handling when no reviews are available.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    This enhancement demonstrates mastery in applying algorithmic principles to solve real-world problems, specifically in user interface optimization and structured data processing. It supports the course outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic techniques while considering performance trade-offs and user experience. Moreover, it complements the overall capstone goal by contributing a meaningful feature that ties together functionality, responsiveness, and user-focused design.
